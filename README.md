Hi, my name is Daniel, I'm a self taught software developer and UI/UX designer based on Brazil.
At this moment, i'm interested in finding good projects on github so I can learn from then, and, in the future, contribute to some projects.
I'm currently sending some side projects, trying to learn how to document my code properly and how to use github correctly.

If you want to talk with me, you can do this through my linkedin or my email:

I'm also practing my english with this projects. I read and listen to lot of content in english, but, I dont write/talk a lot, so, I see this as a great oportunity to get better at this language.
